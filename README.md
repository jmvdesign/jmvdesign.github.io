Welcome to my UX design portfolio! This repository showcases my work as a user experience designer, highlighting my design process, problem-solving abilities, and the skills I've developed through various projects.


## About Me
Hi, I'm Jeff Voreis, a passionate UX designer with a focus on creating user-centered experiences. I believe that great design is not only visually appealing but also intuitive and functional. My portfolio demonstrates a variety of design projects, including wireframes, user flows, prototypes, and more.


## Featured Projects

- Microsoft Cloud Optimizer - IT professionals are moving away from On-Premise Software and moving to Cloud-Based Software. But they can lose sight of their overall spending. The Cloud Optimizer offers full visibility of usage and spending.
- Cinema App - Movie enthusiasts have limited choices. Crowdsourced theater screenings give large groups more bargaining power.
